NextJS | MongoDB | Context API | Next-Auth | JS-Cookie | Bcrypt JS | React Hooks | TailwindCSS


This project mocks the functionalities of an E-Commerce web application. Products are presented to users after fetching them from MongoDB, the Database used. The user can add items they wish to purchase to cart and checkout the items by paying through the use of the integrated Paypal API. Items added to the cart can be removed, can be updated and this is done by use of the Context API for state management. Authentication was built by use of Next-Auth. So, to checkout the items, a user should have already signed in. If not, the user is redirected to do so first. But if the user has no account the user can create an account on the fly and then redirected to continue the checkout process
